# End-game

When the player starts to drill through one of the deep strutures,
    they are warned that they cannot safely return to the surface from inside
    due to the mysterious material being so hard to pierce.
This means that if the player continues inside,
    they secretly enter a checkpoint which the game loads on death.
If the player ends up being poorly-equipped for the end-game,
    they can simply return to the surface after loading their checkpoint.

Beyond that, I have no clue what the end-game will be yet.
